                    Jason Gastrow goes by many names online, but his most popular ones are, Videogamedunkey, Dunkey, and
                    Jason. Jason has been publishing videos online since 2003. Initially, he created Flash animations
                    that
                    he uploaded on the website Newgrounds under the username "MeatwadSprite". Gastrow started his
                    current
                    YouTube channel, videogamedunkey, in 2010, with a video of him performing a speedrun of the 1991
                    game
                    Battletoads. Gastrow recalled that the name "videogamedunkey" came about when he was playing Left 4
                    Dead
                    with a friend.

                    Gastrow initially signed a contract with internet entertainment platform Machinima, Inc., which
                    according to him took a large cut of his earnings from advertising. In 2013, Gastrow switched from
                    Machinima to Maker Studios, which reportedly took more revenue than Machinima. Microsoft offered to
                    pay
                    if he made four videos for Xbox Live's Summer of Arcade. Shortly after Gastrow uploaded the first
                    video,
                    in which he lambasted the game he was playing, Microsoft took down the video and canceled the deal.
                    Gastrow has since worked with, which he has praised.

            In September 2022, Gastrow and his wife launched Bigmode, a video game publishing company specializing
            in
            publishing indie games. Gastrow stated in a video announcing the new company, "I think we're going to
            bring
            insane value to the table and the bottom line is: help good games succeed and help them continue to
            succeed
            into the future". Co-founder Leah Gastrow said their ultimate goal was to "put together a catalogue of
            unique, high-quality games that can be enjoyed for many years." While there was some criticism by gaming
            journalists, the announcement was well received by indie developers. In January 2023, Bigmode announced
            its
            first title, Animal Well.
